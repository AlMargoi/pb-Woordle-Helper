## Description
This is a small script that is supposed to help you solve the Woordle game (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) when you run out of ideas for words to try. 

<br>

## How to use
You need to first try out 1 or 2 words so that you get a list of letters to narrow down your search:
* Good, confirmed letters: letters that are shown by Woordle with yellow. These letters are contained in the solution-word, but are not in the position that you entered them
* Bad, confirmed letters: letters marked with gray in Woordle. These are letters that are not contained by the solution-word. 
* Good letters in known positions: letters marked with green in Woordle. These are letters that are conainted in the solution-word and are in the exact position that you have tried. 

NOTE: The script uses a file that contains around 12.500 5 letters words. So you need to enter few letters in the fields in order to narrow down your search. Otherwise the search will take a very long time and will provide a very long list of words.
